	<h1>HOSPITALITY</h1>
	<p>Hospitality-focused, dedicated to 
		excellence, and highly knowledgeable are just a<br> few terms most often used to describe Frank.
		 This Brooklyn native was immersed in his family’s hospitality and the <br>foodservice industry 
		 from an early age. His father was an energetic and successful restaurateur in Brooklyn who kept
		  Fredrick engaged in <br>the business throughout his youth. At home, his mother embodied 
		  hospitality and regularly hosted gatherings, <br>where Frank absorbed the importance of making
		   people feel welcome. These two environments gave him his strength of character and strong 
		   desire to create warm,<br> inviting atmospheres where people could relax and enjoy themselves.</p>
	<h1>LOCATIONS</h1>
	<p>Frank went on to build a career in 
		hospitality, working in every restaurant position, from server and bartender <br>to ultimately the
		 role of general manager of the fine dining establishment The Modern in New York City.<br> 
		As a general manager, he took the business from a $3 million annual operation to $6 million.
		 <br>The pandemic pushed Frank to explore his skills as a restaurant entrepreneur, which 
		 ultimately led to the birth of Water and Grain, <br>a great pizza experience celebrating
		  the best ingredients, hospitality, and service to the greater New York City region.</p>
