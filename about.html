The first restaurant proprietor is believed to have been one A. Boulanger,<br> a soup vendor, who opened his business in Paris in 1765.
 The sign above his door advertised restoratives, <br>or restaurants, referring to the soups and broths available within. 
 The institution took its name<br>
 from that sign, and restaurant now denotes a public eating place in English,<br> French, Dutch, Danish, Norwegian, Romanian,
 and many other languages, with some variations. <br>For example, in Spanish and Portuguese the word becomes restaurante, in Italian it is ristorante, 
 in Swedish restaurang, in Russian restoran, and in <br>Polish restauracia.

Although inns and hostelries often served paying guests meals from the host’s table, or table d’hôte,<br> and beverages were sold in cafés, Boulanger’s restaurant 
was<br> probably the first public place where any diner might order a meal from a menu offering a choice of dishes.
